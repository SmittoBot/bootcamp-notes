### YelpCamp: Update and Destroy
* When sending a put request, need to append to URL and send as a post request:
```
action=".../edit?_method=PUT" method="POST"
```
* Mongoose has built-in functions for updating objects:
```
Campground.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body.campground, function(err, updatedCampground){
```
